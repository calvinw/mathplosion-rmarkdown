# My is the best ... 

You can see that this is one of the best things we can do. 

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = 54
$$ 

Inline math \\(\frac{2}{3}\\) which which should be 2/3.

Here is some display math that has inline r expressions: 

$$
\frac{x}{4}=\frac{`r 2`}{4} = `r 3/4` 
$$ 

An inline r expression... `r 2+3`... which should be 6. 

Here is inline math with inline r expression... \\(\frac{`r 3`}{2}\\)... it should be input$x/2: 

##WATATATATAT a code block:

```{r hello, collapse=TRUE} 
hist(runif(10)) 
```

# That is it!!!
