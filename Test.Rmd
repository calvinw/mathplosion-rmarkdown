# Problem is the best ... 

ASdasfjka regular text and this is some display math: 

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$ 

Inline math \\(\frac{2}{3}\\) which which should be 2/3.

Here is some display math that has inline r expressions: 

$$
\frac{x}{4}=\frac{`r 2`}{4} = `r 3/4` 
$$ 

An inline r expression... `r 2+3`... which should be 6. 

Here is inline math with inline r expression... \\(\frac{`r 3`}{2}\\)... it should be input$x/2: 

# Here is a code block:

```{r hello, collapse=TRUE} 
hist(runif(10)) 
```

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThats is all!!!
