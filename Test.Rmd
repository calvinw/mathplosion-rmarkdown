# My Test little Problem, this is what I want

Here is a little _markdown_ and here is some display math:   

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = 4
$$ 

Now here is some inline math \(\frac{2}{3}\) which should be 2/3.

Help me, Help me!!!

Here is some display math inline r expressions:   

$$
\frac{x}{4}=\frac{`r 2`}{4} = `r 3/4` 
$$ 

An inline r expression... `r 2+3`... which should be 6. 

Here is inline math with inline r expression... \\(\frac{`r 3`}{2}\\)... it should be input$x/2: 

```{r uniform, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
hist(runif(10)) 
```

# That is it!!!

```{r rnorm, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
hist(rnorm(10)) 
```
